# DataCamp---Vivendo-Food-Claim-Processes

Company Background

Vivendo is a fast food chain in Brazil with over 200 outlets. As with many fast food
establishments, customers make claims against the company. For example, they blame
Vivendo for suspected food poisoning.

The legal team, who processes these claims, is currently split across four locations. The new
head of the legal department wants to see if there are differences in the time it takes to close
claims across the locations.

Customer Question
The legal team has given you a data set where each row is a claim made against the
company. They would like you to answer the following questions:
  ● How does the number of claims differ across locations?
  ● What is the distribution of time to close claims?
  ● How does the average time to close claims differ by location?
